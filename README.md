# 🍂 Odin Recipes

A multi-page recipe website built as part of **The Odin Project's HTML Foundations** course.

This project began as a simple HTML exercise, but I expanded it to include a fully styled homepage using **Flexbox**, **Google Fonts**, and responsive **CSS** techniques. It represents my first real dive into building structured, multi-page web layouts — complete with semantic HTML, relative paths, and clean styling practices.

## 🗒️ Reflections
This project started with pure HTML, but I challenged myself to make it feel like a *real* website.  
I’m especially proud of:
- Refining the **visual consistency** across pages  
- Implementing **responsive design logic** even before Odin’s formal CSS responsiveness section  
- And finally — the small design polish touches (like hover transitions) that make a big difference in professionalism.
