# Odin Recipes
A simple multi-page recipe website built as part of The Odin Project's HTML Foundations course.

This project focuses on practicing basic HTML structure and building multiple pages linked together. It helped me reinforce concepts like semantic HTML, relative paths, and using lists and images properly.
